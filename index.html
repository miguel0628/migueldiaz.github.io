      <p align= "Center"><i>Since I was in highschool I always saw myself being surrounded by technology because I was influenced my Godfather he graduated with a degree on System Information.<br>
                        Afterwards I got an insight of the PUPR curriculm becuase my cousin graduated of Computer Engeneering and that's when I decided I wanted to attend the Polytechnic University.<br>
        Since the start of my univeristy experience I've been searching for my passion inside the world of computers and tecnologies and let me tell it has been easy.<br>
        At the moment I'm 23 years at my senior level, my graduation is on October 2020.I can tell you now after six years of studying the areas that interest me are Computer Networks and Web Development.
